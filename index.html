    <p>The world changes everyday. Even small decisions can change a lot. But how do you know what decisions
        are made
        by someone you vote? We think our voters should know a lot more about everything. But how? These days
        social media is a big thing. People post everything and sometimes it's very unnecessary. But social media is
        a great way to keep our voters up to date and to give them a taste of how we work and what we do.</p>
